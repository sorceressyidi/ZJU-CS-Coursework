Run 'make' in command line to compile the program.

Run './main' to execute the program.

The MAXNODE of a graph is 500000, which can be modified in the header file 'graph.h'.

We present a sample of our dataset in the code folder `50data.gr` to give a brief example.Detailed dataset with different sizes can be found in the link below.

Our dataset are obtained in http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml

US-Road dataset are downloaded directly, others are generated by a random graph generator provided in the link.
